Cameras doesnt need to be connected on bootup. 

$ spread configure                *pages is needed, not focus.

$ spread web     *lets you capture, recapture and download. But does not support pedal. 

I will stick to

$ spread capture name     so i can use the pedal. I will need to use scan tailor and so forth in windows. 




*interface button is dependent on restart button which auto shuts down. Terminal input is thus required.
